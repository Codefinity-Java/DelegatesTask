# Description

**Your task** is to define a delegate type called `Operation`, which can refer to the methods that have the same signature as the `max` and `avg` methods. 

> Currently there is no delegate definition so the program doesn't compile, however after defining the delegate type you should be able to successfully compile and run the program, indicating that your solution is correct.
